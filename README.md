#a. What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?
##ans : I chose NOSQL database because inserts are a lot faster in nosql than sql. The other reason is nosql is free from join operations.


#b. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
##ans : Loading the data into mongodb and reading from it was easy. That was the main difference from project 1 and project 2.

#c. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
##ans : Getting the animation to work on each row of the table was difficult while using ng-repeat of angular. So when ever the model was updates with each 
##item, the animation did not work as the whole view was recreated. A work around had to be done for that.

#d. If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
#concern?
##ans : My concern would be the security issues when it comes to nosql. Mongodb needs security overhead. So security and abstraction of data would be my main concern.
